## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=5030K0koAP5IoVSu1SzjpNadONU
Your Rationale: Most gaming systems focus on bright colors as it will catch the human eye. So with that in mind I chose a group of colors that would provoke a childlike reaction when I see it. Like a "oh what's that?!" response.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3500C0kq5OMfiV3lgSsxpNnJyxP
Your Rationale: Spring is all about bright colors between the sun and all the flowers. So that's why I chose the colors shown here. Bright green grass, sunny yellow and a purple I can find in orchids (which is my favorite flower)

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=33C0u0ko-vPJ4w5vXB8iXvubGzS
Your Rationale: With it being private I chose colors that would not attract a lot of attention unless you wanted someone to see something. Blue is supposedly a calming color which is why I wanted it to be included in this triad. Especially if one might be looking at it for some time, might as well make it easy on their eyes and mood.


4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=15-0u0kmYvhGmxNtyzmhjvF9eAY
Your Rationale: Not very creative reasoning for this one: Ruby on Rails -> ruby -> red. It would be easy to recall the coding language, especially with a color that represents a part of the name. I chose a more pastel-type base simply for the sake of the eyes.
