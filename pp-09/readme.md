# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.http://drpete.co/topic/25-point-website-usability-checklist
2.https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Clear point of why they are doing this
2. The webpage is simple (easier to add than take away)
3. Style is consistent throughout (no guess work needing to be done for links or buttons)
4.Easy to read 
5. See if they can get to a specific item or list easily
6. Is it intuitive? Maybe place hints
7. Color! But not too much. A nice background with well placed contrast sections and boxes will work
8. Logos, Company names, important people are visible
9. Don't be afraid to ask them questions, feedback is needed not optional
10. It works across multiple browsers and versions
