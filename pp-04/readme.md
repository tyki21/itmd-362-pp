## ITMD 362 Production Problem 4: Form Styling and Web Fonts

For this production problem, build off the existing CSS, including its baseline grid and typographic (modular) scale, and design a mobile-scale form that uses only shades of gray (no solid borders) for the input regions. Favor an open design with plenty of padding and white space.

Then, set up the `font-family` with a robust custom font stack made up of commonly available system fonts. You might use a site like http://www.cssfontstack.com to get yourself started.

Finally, use the Google Web Font Loader, https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader, to load a custom Google Font from https://fonts.google.com that is in harmony with your chosen system-font stack. Try using one of the fonts listed on pp. 36-37 of Luptonâ€™s *Type on Screen* book.

Be sure to handle all CSS styles for the Google font using the class hooks from the Web Font Loader. Those should appear in the State Styles area of your stylesheet.
